# Proteomic assessment of senescence exosomes
 Mass spectrometry analysis and visualisation

This project was my introduction to bioinformatics. I utilised R/RStudio to analyse and visualise 3 large-scale mass spectrometry datasets through a combination of heatmaps, volcano plots, gene ontology, hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). I published the majority of the work in the Journal of Extracellular Vesicles. The final dataset remains unpublished but is publicly available via the link to my thesis.

# Project Details 

The project contains all the data that was used to construct the paper figures.

MS1: _Volcano Plot and GO Localisation assessment of dUC EVs_

MS2: _Venn Diagram, GO Localisation and Heatmap analysis of SEC fraction 20 (co-isolated), fraction 8 (exosomes) and CM_

MS3: _PCA and Hierarchical Clustering of EC fraction 20 (co-isolated), fraction 8 (exosomes) and CM from OIS and vector control IMR90s_
